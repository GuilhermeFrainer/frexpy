# Purpose
This project is essentially a translation of the exclusivity function of the
R stm package.
It calculates a metric of topic exclusivity to be used to evaluate topics
when doing topic modelling.
I couldn't find an equivalent in Python, so I wrote my own.

Source code for the original function available [here](https://github.com/bstewart/stm/blob/master/R/exclusivity.R).
Documentation for the package available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stm/vignettes/stmVignette.pdf).
